And while the concept of a vibrator seems pretty straightforward at first, once you begin shopping for one, you'll find yourself inundated with toys of all shapes and sizes that are intended for use on different parts of the body. Many of these toys, such as the phallic ones, appear intuitive, but there are also a slew of toys incorporating new sex toy technologies and more abstract (and inclusive) designs.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, vibrators tend to fall into a few basic categories. Once you know what each one is and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/how-to-use-a-vibrator/>how to use each type of vibrator</a>, you'll be more empowered to make the best decisions for yourself and/or your partner on your next sex toy shopping spree. Below, check out our expert-vetted explainer on each type of vibrator, so you'll be ready for your most well-informed (and most fun) vibrator experience yet.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-wand-vibrator><span>The Wand Vibrator</span></h2><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/best-wand-vibrators/>Wand vibrators</a> (also known as personal massagers) are among the most popular and recognizable sex toys of all time.

Indeed, these vibrators can also double as massagers for erogenous zones or simply for tired or achy parts of the body.</p><p>When it comes to how to use them, Stewart says, "You always need to read the directions for whatever wand vibrator that you have, as many of them have different speeds and modes and even attachments. Some of them are rechargeable and some are battery-operated or plug-in, so make sure that you follow the directions according to the company. Typically wands are used on the clitoris, but there are attachments that can be used for penetration. If you are using it on your clitoris and you are a squirter, it's highly recommended that you use a waterproof wand because you don't want to cause the wand any damage from fluid, which could void any warranty you have."</p><a href=# data-model-name="Lovehoney Dream Wand Rechargeable Mini Massage Wand Vibrator" data-url=https://www.lovehoney.com/sex-toys/vibrators/massage-wand-vibrators/p/lovehoney-dream-wand-rechargeable-mini-massage-wand-vibrator/a40765g76619.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://lovehoneyus.sjv.io/c/221109/1243033/15309?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fvibrators%2Fmassage-wand-vibrators%2Fp%2Flovehoney-dream-wand-rechargeable-mini-massage-wand-vibrator%2Fa40765g76619.html" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lovehoney.com data-merchant-id=211514 data-merchant-url=lovehoney.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fZZMtzrV84ndYS9Z4Tik2Y-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Lovehoney Dream Wand Rechargeable Mini Massage Wand Vibrator</p><p>"For beginners and partner play, the Lovehoney Dream Wand Rechargeable Mini Massage Wand Vibrator is a great choice thanks to its size," says <a href=# data-url=https://javaydabae.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Javay Frye-Nekrasova</a>, a sexpert for <a href=# data-url=https://www.lovehoney.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://lovehoneyus.sjv.io/c/221109/1243033/15309?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2F" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lovehoney.com data-merchant-id=211514 data-merchant-url=lovehoney.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad>Lovehoney</a>.

AASECT Certified Sex Therapist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.onthegreencouch.com/about.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Shamyra Howard</a> explains, "The g-spot is said to be a sensitive area located at least two to three inches inside the vagina. One way to stimulate the area is by using a finger in the 'come here' motion."

"Not only does it have 12 vibrations," she says, "but the ridges on the outside stimulate the entrance to the vaginal canal, which is one of the most sensitive parts of the vagina." She also adds that it's completely waterproof and submersible, "just in case you want to take it in the tub with you. What's cool about this vibrator is that it has a turbo boost for each vibrational setting, so you get that kickstart every time you move up a level!"</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-rabbit-vibrator><span>The Rabbit Vibrator</span></h2><p>Are you a fan of both clitoral and g-spot stimulation? Then consider the widely beloved <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/best-rabbit-vibrators/>rabbit vibrator</a>. "A rabbit vibrator is a classic sex toy that originally was designed with a long insertable portion for the vaginal canal and an outer clitoral stimulation portion that looked like bunny ears," says Frye-Nekrasova. "Over the decades the designs have changed where some rabbits now don't have the traditional bunny ears, but they still have the dual stimulation with an insertable portion and an outer portion that touches the clitoris."</p><p>In recent years, a variety of rabbit vibrators have also been designed for long-distance play, partner play, and solo masturbation.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Lovers Juicy G Dual Vibrator" data-url=https://loversstores.com/products/lovers-juicy-g-dual-vibe referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1587397&u=1338591&m=99778&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2Fproducts%2Flovers-juicy-g-dual-vibe" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=loversstores.com data-merchant-id=282463 data-merchant-url=loversstores.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7kwm5ghEexcdqttd2AGBJ-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Lovers Juicy G Dual Vibrator</p><p>Stewart calls this option "the next gen version of the old rabbit," and it's at the top of her recommendations list. She explains, "Instead of a flickering of the ears for the clitoris, the clitoral vibrator is able to vibrate while applying pressure for those who need more pressure on their clitoris. &nbsp;With this vibrator, you can have an extended session, as its maximum run time is 50 minutes; this means that you can take your time to enjoy your orgasm without worrying about if it will die on you.

"Instead, they’re surrounding the head of the clitoris to create a suction-like sensation."</p><p>These toys are particularly appealing to people who enjoy oral sex or prefer clitoral stimulation that's gentler than the type provided by a wand or bullet vibrator. With a clitoral suction vibrator, Dr. O'Reilly says, a "unique pleasure massage is created by tiny changes in air pressure that surround the head of the clitoris — providing indirect stimulation that tends to create deeper sensations of pleasure and orgasm."</p><a href=# data-model-name="Womanizer Premium Rechargeable Smart Silence Clitoral Suction Stimulator" data-url=https://www.lovehoney.com/sex-toys/vibrators/clitoral-suction-vibrators/p/womanizer-premium-rechargeable-smart-silence-clitoral-suction-stimulator/a40149g73388.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://lovehoneyus.sjv.io/c/221109/1243033/15309?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fvibrators%2Fclitoral-suction-vibrators%2Fp%2Fwomanizer-premium-rechargeable-smart-silence-clitoral-suction-stimulator%2Fa40149g73388.html" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lovehoney.com data-merchant-id=211514 data-merchant-url=lovehoney.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43UHUBdoDRQ5VR6CUdhCRo-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Womanizer Premium Rechargeable Smart Silence Clitoral Suction Stimulator</p><p>Dr. O'Reilly is a big fan of the Womanizer toy, citing its patented Pleasure Air technology and how customizable it is. "Womanizer toys come with changeable 'heads' so you can customize the size according to your specific needs," she explains. "Some people have a clitoral head/glans that is highly visible and others find that theirs is more 'hidden' under the clitoral hood. You can often retract the skin of the hood to reveal the head, but some people prefer to play with toys over the hood for a more subtle sensation."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-remote-vibrator><span>The Remote Vibrator</span></h2><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.drlauriemintz.com/about-laurie-mintz referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Laurie Mintz,</a> a tenured Professor of the Psychology of Human Sexuality, says that this type of vibrator "can be controlled remotely," meaning that you don't need to press any buttons on the actual toy in order to get it to work.&nbsp;</p><p>"There are generally three types of these toys," Dr. Mintz tells us.

"These are terrific for long-distance relationships, yet there is a caution associated with them, and that is that it’s important to choose a toy with proper security and anonymization to avoid being vulnerable to the image of you being exposed."</p><p>For that reason, check out our comprehensive list of the best remote vibrators, which have been vetted so you can have fun without worrying about any invasions of privacy.</p><a href=# data-model-name="We-Vibe Chorus" data-url=https://www.lovehoney.com/sex-toys/vibrators/clitoral-vibrators/p/we-vibe-chorus-app-and-remote-controlled-rechargeable-couples-vibrator/a44877g80788.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://lovehoneyus.sjv.io/c/221109/1243033/15309?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fvibrators%2Fclitoral-vibrators%2Fp%2Fwe-vibe-chorus-app-and-remote-controlled-rechargeable-couples-vibrator%2Fa44877g80788.html" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lovehoney.com data-merchant-id=211514 data-merchant-url=lovehoney.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E32roybYDQUP6UnAQ7MGEB-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>We-Vibe Chorus</p><p>"Because We-Vibe has produced several versions of this toy over the years, the updated Chorus has been thoughtfully updated and designed for comfort and pleasure," Dr. O'Reilly attests.

Frye-Nekrasova says, "Vibrating panties are vibrators design to sit in the underwear and stimulate the clitoris. They can come with a specific panty or be designed to fit into any and all panties. You use them by placing them in the portion of the panties that sits against the clitoris or other parts of the vulva you want to stimulate and you can control the functions with the remote that comes with the panties or the vibe."&nbsp;</p><p>Just be sure, when you buy, that you test out the toys before wearing and using them in public. No one wants to find themselves accidentally reenacting that notorious scene from When Harry Met Sally.</p><a href=# data-model-name="We-Vibe Moxie App and Remote Controlled Wearable Clitoral Panty Vibrator" data-url=https://www.lovehoney.com/sex-toys/vibrators/vibrating-panties/p/we-vibe-moxie-app-and-remote-controlled-wearable-clitoral-knicker-vibrator/a41208g82226.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://lovehoneyus.sjv.io/c/221109/1243033/15309?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fvibrators%2Fvibrating-panties%2Fp%2Fwe-vibe-moxie-app-and-remote-controlled-wearable-clitoral-knicker-vibrator%2Fa41208g82226.html" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lovehoney.com data-merchant-id=211514 data-merchant-url=lovehoney.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tmpe7GNx2MezjoznQgXVfm-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>We-Vibe Moxie App and Remote Controlled Wearable Clitoral Panty Vibrator</p><p>Dr. Jess O'Reilly calls this "the ultimate panty vibe" because of how "powerful, quiet, slim, and really discreet" it is.

As examples, she lists "anal beads that vibrate, vibrating butt plugs and prostate massagers."</p><p>Our experts remind us, though, to be sure to only use sex toys that are specifically marked as and made for anal use. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.drzhana.com/about referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Zhana Vrangalova,</a> a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.lelo.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100577549-15549178?sid=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https://www.lelo.com/" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lelo.com data-merchant-id=282279 data-merchant-url=lelo.com data-merchant-network=CJ>LELO </a>Sexpert and NYU Professor of Human Sexuality, explains that anal vibrators "are typically shaped differently to fit the anatomy of the rectum rather than the clitoris and vagina, and they typically have a tapered end so they don't get lost inside the rectum (something that's not of concern with clitoral and vaginal vibrators)."</p><p>Furthermore, she reminds us to "apply plenty of lube that's compatible with the material of the vibrator." For clarification on how to find the right lube that's compatible with the material your anal toys are made of, check out our guide to the best lubes.</p><p>Finally, when it comes to anal stimulation, remember that slow and steady wins the race. "Go slow," says Dr. Vrangalova. "Build it up slowly and gently, going from a finger or a thin vibrator to a larger one as the sphincter relaxes." Plus, to avoid embarrassing and/or messy situations, she advises taking precautions.</p><p>"Go to the bathroom a couple of hours before anal play. Make sure you don't feel like you have to go right before you're about to play," she says, adding, "Clean out your anus with soap and water. You could do an enema, although it's not really necessary unless you're planning on stuffing really big vibrators in there. Don't eat spicy or otherwise diarrhea-inducing types of meals the night before."</p><p>For more specific tips on how to use an anal vibrator, take a look at our comprehensive guide on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/how-to-use-a-vibrator/#section-how-to-use-an-anal-vibrator>how to use every type of vibrator</a> as well as our round-up of the best anal vibrators you can buy online.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Lovehoney High Roller Remote Control Rotating Prostate Massager" data-url=https://www.lovehoney.com/sex-toys/male-sex-toys/prostate-massagers/p/lovehoney-high-roller-remote-control-rotating-prostate-massager/a42638g76716.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://lovehoneyus.sjv.io/c/221109/1243033/15309?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fmale-sex-toys%2Fprostate-massagers%2Fp%2Flovehoney-high-roller-remote-control-rotating-prostate-massager%2Fa42638g76716.html" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lovehoney.com data-merchant-id=211514 data-merchant-url=lovehoney.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ByPECgoZekShFbMdoaE8Ld-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Lovehoney High Roller Remote Control Rotating Prostate Massager</p><p>Dr. O'Reilly loves this toy for advanced users in particular.
