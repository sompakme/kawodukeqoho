The chair ended up landing close to two officers who arrested Wallen and charged with three counts of reckless endangerment and one count of disorderly conduct. He was released hours later.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks,” Wallen <a href=# rel=nofollow>tweeted</a> following the incident. “I’ve touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief’s. I’m not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility.”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.9112207151665><h2>Jimmie Allen’s Affair & Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1792234337.jpg><p>Jimmie Allen and his ex-wife Alexis Gale were one of Hollywood’s biggest power couples until everything came to a screeching halt in April 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>In one <a href=#>announcement</a>, Allen revealed that he and Gale (who was pregnant with their third child) were going their separate ways and that he was expecting a child with another woman.&nbsp;</p><p>“As we navigate this life change, we can also share that we will be welcoming another child together later this year,” Allen wrote in a statement at the time. “Our number one priority is and always will be ensuring that our children are healthy, happy and loved, and we remain committed to co-parenting with love and respect for one another.”</p><p>The pair had been married since 2021.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.828978622328><h2>Jason Aldean’s Controvesial Small Town Song</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1246733678.jpg><p>In 2023, Jason Aldean’s new song “Try That in a Small Town” garnered national attention as it was coined a pro-gun, racist, “modern lynching” song, per <a href=#>Billboard</a>.</p><p>Among the lyrics are, “See how far ya make it down the road / Around here, we take care of our own / You cross that line, it won’t take long / For you to find out, I recommend you don’t / Try that in a small town.”</p><p>Following the backlash, Aldean attempted to clarify the song’s intention. “I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests. These references are not only meritless but dangerous,” he wrote on Instagram, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Billboard</a>. “There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn’t a single video clip that isn’t real news footage.”</p><p>“While I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music- this one goes too far,” he continued. “NO ONE, including me, wants to continue to see senseless headlines or families ripped apart.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.9372509960159><h2>Beyoncé’s ‘Cowboy Carter’ Origin Story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1253911219.jpg><p>While Beyoncé’s 2016 CMA performance with The Chicks only proved that there is nothing the star can’t do, it didn’t go down too well with some country music loyalists.</p><p>After the performance, some vocalized their disapproval of the performance for a multitude of reasons ranging from criticism of Beyoncé’s liberal-leaning politics, her perceived lack of country music experience, and a dislike of The Chicks (more on that later!) But a lot of the response was just downright racist.</p><p>Of course, Beyoncé turned lemons into lemonade when she released her 2024 country album “Cowboy Carter” alongside a message that many took as a belated response to the CMAs incident.&nbsp;</p><p>“This album has been over five years in the making. It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed…and it was very clear that I wasn’t,” <a href=#>she wrote</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.8224852071006><h2>Morgan Wallen’s Racism</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beyonce-cma-awards.jpg><p>In February 2021, video of Morgan Wallen surfaced, featuring the country singer using a racial slur while near his Nashville home. Months later, he made an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#>Good Morning America</a>, where he offered an apology.</p><p>“I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back,” the singer said. “There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.”</p><p>Despite the incident, Wallen has continued to receive many award show nominations and remains a popular country music artist.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.98269230769231><h2>Brittany Aldean’s Transphobia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1426802278.jpg><p>Jason Aldean and his wife Brittany’s conservative political views are no secret.

Unfortunately, not everyone was convinced that the artist’s tune was country enough. After the song broke to No. 19 on the Hot Country chart, Billboard removed the song from the genre’s ranking list but kept it on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop list.&nbsp;</p><p>Billboard issued a statement, saying, the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version,” per <a href=#>CBS</a>.</p><p>Lil Nas X, however, was totally unbothered by the situation. “The song is country trap. It’s not one, it’s not the other,” the artist shared in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Time</a>. “It’s both.
