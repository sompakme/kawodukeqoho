Season 3 of the Netflix reality series premiered on December 12, 2023, introducing a new group of gorgeous singles who will brave the elements with the hopes of finding love and making it to "Paradise." In case you didn't catch the first or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/singles-inferno-cast-season-2/>second seasons</a>, the dating show drops a group of beautiful people onto a bare-bones deserted island called "Inferno" where they have the chance to pair up and escape. The matched couples will spend the evening in the "Paradise" (a luxury hotel date) while the rest are left to dine on root vegetables and canned chicken breast before spending the night in what looks like shipping containers.</p><p>For season 3, Single's Inferno has been through a revamp, introducing a new face to the commentary panel (season 2 contestant Kim Ji-young, a.k.a. Dex, joins regular hosts Hong Jin-kyung, Lee Da-hee, Kyuhyun, and Haehae); a new hotel setting for Paradise; and a shocking twist to Inferno. (I'll leave you to watch, but think Casa Amour for any Love Island fans.) The show's producers have also found an intriguing new cast, which includes several pageant queens, a real-life rescue hero, and an already-famous professional athlete. Read on to get to know the cast of Single's Inferno season 3.</p><p><strong>Warning: Spoilers for episodes 1-5 ahead.</strong></p><h2 id=kim-gyu-ri-3>Kim Gyu-ri</h2><p>Fashion and beauty model Gyu-ri was a runner-up for Miss Korea 2022.
