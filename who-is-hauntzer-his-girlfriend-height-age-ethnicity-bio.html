It was from there that he moved on to Team SoloMid.</span></p><p><span>In 2018, Hauntzer made a rather shocking move from TSM to the team he now plays for, Golden Guardians.&nbsp;The transfer didn’t just shock fans and followers of the sport;&nbsp;it was also up to Kevin who revealed that he had not been given notice of the transfer in progress or a provision allowing him to share the starting points he had lost.</span></p><p><span>During his three years with the organization, he proved to be even better than the good player everyone expected him to be.&nbsp;Even when the team had a very difficult season in 2018, he was still in sight.&nbsp;Nonetheless, he was later dropped from the starting lineup for Sergen “Broken Blade” Çelik.&nbsp;With the team, he won three NA LCS playoff titles.</span></p><p><span>With GGS, he again secured the top spot among top laners, alongside big names such as Kim “Olleh” Joo-sung, Henrik “Froggen” Hansen, and Juan “Contractz” Garcia.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his move, the prolific top lanerEven though he didn’t think it was the wisest move from his former team, it was still a good opportunity for him as it allowed him to be in a better situation.</span></p><p><span>From 19 tournaments, Kevin who is as of 2019 ranked 733 in the world and 150 in the US has generated a total earning of over $135,000 over the 19 tournaments he has participated in.&nbsp;He’s recorded a lot in his career, winning the Riot NA LCS three times and placing second and third once.&nbsp;He also won the 2017 Rift Rivals.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>When it comes to his relationship side of life, Hauntzer also tries to keep his balance just like he plays his games.&nbsp;For someone who has a girlfriend, one of the main issues he had with TSM was that he was always too busy to even call his girlfriend and do other little things.</span></p><p><span>He had a relationship with a woman identified as Hana.&nbsp;The two have been a topic of discussion on social media for the past few years.&nbsp;In 2018, he shared a photo of it on his Instagram account.&nbsp;they were having a good time skating.&nbsp;Hana also shares her photo with Kevin on her social media pages.&nbsp;Although little is known about Hana, it is known that she has a Twitch account that has over 4,000 followers.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Hauntzer’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kevin Yarnell is a very tall man who is 5 feet 10 inches tall.&nbsp;This is complemented by his body and athleticism.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMoZiupqSvsrN5x6KqZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lmJq2qLTTZpignV2awam6yJygrbFdl7awew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-hauntzer-his-girlfriend-height-age-ethnicity-bio.html&text=Who%20is%20Hauntzer%3fHis%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Bio&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-hauntzer-his-girlfriend-height-age-ethnicity-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hauntzer-his-girlfriend-height-age-ethnicity-bio.html&title=Who%20is%20Hauntzer%3fHis%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-hauntzer-his-girlfriend-height-age-ethnicity-bio.html&title=Who%20is%20Hauntzer%3fHis%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hauntzer-his-girlfriend-height-age-ethnicity-bio.html&title=Who%20is%20Hauntzer%3fHis%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-hauntzer-his-girlfriend-height-age-ethnicity-bio.html&description=Who%20is%20Hauntzer%3fHis%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alan-thicke-dead-hollywood-pays-tribute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alan Thicke Dead: Hollywood Pays Tribute">&larr;
