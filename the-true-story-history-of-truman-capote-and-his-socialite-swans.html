All immensely rich, beautiful and regulars on the best-dressed list, they were all often seen out with Capote at New York events, despite shuttling between homes in the Hamptons and Venice by way of Paris.</p><img alt="truman capote, babe paley, gloria guinness" title="Gloria Guinness, Truman Capote, Barbara &amp;amp;amp;quot;Babe&amp;amp;amp;quot; Paley" width=2344 height=3508 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-541051933-652e5fe6c5797.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ullstein bild Dtl.</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Truman Capote with Babe Paley (right) and Gloria Guinness</p><img alt="november 1966 american novelist, truman capote 1924 1984, dancing with jackie kennedy's sister, princess lee radziwill, at his black and white ball at the plaza hotel, new york photo by harry bensonexpressgetty images" title="Truman And Lee" width=3744 height=2495 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3137702-652e6d2ec68d6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Harry Benson</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Truman Capote dancing with Lee Radziwill at his famous Black And White Ball in 1966</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The swans dominated the headlines: CZ Guest, a cover girl and muse to Andy Warhol and Salvador Dalí, rode a white horse into the ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria in 1955, decades before Bianca Jagger tried the same stunt at Studio 54. Pamela Harriman married Winston Churchill’s son, before becoming the US ambassador in Paris. Slim Keith (who is credited with bringing Lauren Bacall to Hollywood's attention) even shared a husband with Harriman – Leland Hayward – who left the former for the latter in 1960.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Capote and his swans lived in the spotlight of New York's high society. In 1966, Capote hosted the now-legendary masked ball, The Black And White Ball, at the Plaza Hotel – considered the event of the season, it cemented his status as one of the city's best-loved socialites.</p><img alt="original caption following its annual poll of more than 1,000 fashion experts and other authorities, the couture group of the new york dress institute today issued the 1956 list of the world's best dressed women babe paley mrs william paley, of new york, a perennial on the list, is tied for first place with movie star grace kelly on the newest roster" title="Babe Paley on a Stairwell" width=4006 height=3130 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-515014548-65b781e0a2107.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Babe Paley pictured in 1956</p><img alt="feud capote vs the swans" title="Feud Capote Vs The Swans" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gallery-naomi-watts-babe-paley-0022-v5-65b781ff6c6e4.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PARI DUKOVIC PHOTOGRAPHY</span><p>Naomi Watts as Babe Paley</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What was their feud all about?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Through his jet set social life, Capote had been gathering observations for a tell-all novel, Answered Prayers. The book, which Capote had been planning stages since 1958, was constantly postponed, until he permitted Esquire to publish four chapters of the unfinished novel in 1975 and 1976. The first to appear, 'Mojave', ran as a self-contained short story and was favourably received, but the second, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a40376194/truman-capote-la-cote-basque/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="'La Côte Basque 1965'" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">'La Côte Basque 1965'</a>, marked the beginning of Capote's social suicide.</p><img alt="13th june 1967 princess lee radziwill, sister of jacqueline kennedy photo by reg burkettexpressgetty images" title="Lee Radziwill" width=3155 height=3210 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3232460-65b78317b0a6f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Reg Burkett</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Lee Radziwill in 1967</p><img alt="feud capote vs the swans" title="Feud Capote vs The Swans" width=1600 height=1067 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gallery-calista-flockhart-lee-radziwell-0301-v3-65b7833abfaed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PARI DUKOVIC PHOTOGRAPHY</span><p>Calista Flockhart as Lee Radziwill</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Based in part on the dysfunctional personal lives of Capote's friends, its much-discussed betrayal of trust alienated Capote from his swans, who were featured in the text – sometimes under pseudonyms but also by their real names. The chapter aired the dirty laundry of New York's elite, and spilled everything from gossip about Princess Margaret and the rest of the British royal family, to a description of Jackie Kennedy Onassis as "unrefined, exaggerated".</p><img alt="the socialite ann woodward, who was accused of murdering her husband" title="The socialite Ann Woodward, who was accused of murdering her husband" width=3133 height=4340 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-515024650-652e6d84118df.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The socialite Ann Woodward, who was accused of murdering her husband, pictured in 1955</p><img alt="feud capote vs the swans" title="Feud Capote vs The Swans" width=1600 height=1067 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gallery-demi-moore-ann-woodward-0201-v4-65b7826ac323e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PARI DUKOVIC PHOTOGRAPHY</span><p>Demi Moore as Ann Woodward</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Capote lifted the lid on extramarital affairs, and even accused former showgirl Ann Woodward of murdering her husband.

The aftermath of the publication is said to have pushed him to new levels of drug abuse and alcoholism, as he claimed not to have anticipated the backlash it would cause.

In 1978, talk show host Stanley Siegel did an on-air interview with Capote, who, intoxicated, confessed he'd been awake for two days. "I'll kill myself... without meaning to," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/12/truman-capote-answered-prayers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he said" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">he said</a>. The live broadcast made national headlines.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the revocation of his driver's license (the result of speeding near his Long Island residence) and a hallucination-based seizure in 1980 that required hospitalisation, Capote became fairly reclusive. On the rare occasions when he was lucid, he continued to promote Answered Prayers as being nearly complete, and was reportedly planning a reprise of The Black And White Ball.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Capote died in Los Angeles in 1984, from liver disease complicated by intoxication, aged 59.
