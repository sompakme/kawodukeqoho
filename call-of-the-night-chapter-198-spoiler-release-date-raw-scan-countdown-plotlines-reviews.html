Nazuna’s father then grabbed Kou by the neck and lifted him up, threatening to kill him.</p><p>However, before he could do so, Nazuna intervened and stopped her father. She told him that she loved Kou and that she wanted to be with him. She also told him that she was not afraid of becoming a vampire and that she was ready to accept the consequences. She then asked her father to let them go and to leave them alone.</p><p>Nazuna’s father was shocked and angry by Nazuna’s words. He accused her of being brainwashed by Kou and of betraying her family. He then tried to attack Kou again, but Nazuna blocked his way and shielded Kou with her body. She told her father that she was not brainwashed and that she was making her own choice. She also told him that she was not betraying her family, but rather choosing her own happiness. She then asked her father to respect her decision and to let them live their own lives.</p><p>Nazuna’s father was speechless and stunned by Nazuna’s determination and courage. He realized that he could not change Nazuna’s mind and that he had no right to interfere with her life. He then let go of Kou and Nazuna and told them to do as they pleased. He also told them that he would not bother them anymore and that he would leave them alone.

They then hugged each other and expressed their love and gratitude for each other. They also decided to leave the city and to start a new life together somewhere else. They then packed their bags and left the apartment, ready to face the new challenges and adventures that awaited them.</p><p>What will happen in Call Of The Night Chapter 198?
