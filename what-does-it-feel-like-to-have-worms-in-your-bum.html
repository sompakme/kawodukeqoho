Stool samples must be collected before you take any anti-diarrhea drugs or antibiotics, or before x-rays with barium are taken. Several stool samples may be needed to find the parasite.<h2>How do you get rid of pinworms overnight?</h2>Shower daily in the morning to remove pinworm eggs that may have been deposited overnight.
