Rembis was not available for comment Friday but has scheduled interviews with media on Monday.</p><p>The news release said that Maui Health will be planning for a smooth transition and will initiate a national search for a new CEO. Sources with knowledge of the transition but not authorized to speak publicly said Rembis will be available as a consultant through the end of the year and that Kaiser Permanente plans to bring in someone on an interim basis in February or March.</p><p>Rembis joined Maui Health a year after Maui Memorial Medical Center, Kula Hospital and Lanai Community Hospital transitioned from being public hospitals to one under Maui Health System, an affiliate with Kaiser. Rembis had to deal with the outfall of the transition, including contracts with unions and staff unhappy about the change.</p><p>He was also at the helm as the COVID-19 pandemic hit and dealt with outbreaks at the hospital with patients and staff.</p><p>As cases mounted, the outbreak spurred criticism from health care workers who were frustrated over hospital policies and community members who called for the removal of top leadership. Criticism of the administration has continued on.</p><p>But Rembis and his staff also set up community vaccine clinics around the island and at the hospital which immunized thousands.</p><p>The news release said that under Rembis’ leadership there were <span class=quotations>“significant improvements”</span> for the three main hospitals along with the Maui Memorial Outpatient Clinic and Kula Clinic. It also noted that Maui Health has consistently received national recognition in heart, stroke and diabetes care. Also under Rembis’ leadership, Maui Health recently opened the Wound Care and Hyperbaric Therapy Center and led the recruitment of several new physician specialists.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Mike has guided Maui Health through a critical time in health care and through the unforeseen challenges of the global pandemic,”</span> said Kim Horn, executive vice president and group president at Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals. <span class=quotations>“I am grateful for his leadership and look forward to his partnership as we plan for this leadership transition.”</span></p><p>Also in the news release, Clay Sutherland, a member of the Maui Health board of directors said, <span class=quotations>“Mike has provided excellent, experienced leadership. His collaborative nature and determination to improve the quality of care and increase the access to more physician specialists for our community is a significant legacy.”</span></p><p>United Public Workers State Director Kalani Werner in a statement Friday afternoon extended its appreciation for Rembis’ service and wished him well.</p><p>But Werner noted how Maui Health <span class=quotations>“has not yet offered our members a fair contract despite more than eight months of negotiations.”</span></p><p>UPW is the union that represents nearly 500 nurse aids, respiratory therapists, housekeepers, cooks and other hospital workers.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We hope that the new CEO will prioritize the needs of our dedicated workforce by offering a contract that fairly compensates them for their hard work and dedication to providing high-quality healthcare to the Maui community,”</span> Werner added.</p><p>He said the union looks forward <span class=quotations>“to collaborating with the new leadership”</span> to address the ongoing challenges facing the healthcare system as well as reaching a fair contract agreement.</p><p>Maui lawmakers state Sen. Gil Keith-Agaran and state Rep. Troy Hashimoto, whose districts both include Maui Memorial Medical Center, gave credit to Rembis but also voiced support for a new CEO to be <span class=quotations>“someone familiar”</span> with the local healthcare system.</p><p><span class=quotations>“He took on the tough job implementing the transition of the hospitals from state management and guiding them through the height of the pandemic,”</span> Keith-Agaran said in a text message. He also wished Rembis well on his retirement.</p><p>Said Hashimoto: <span class=quotations>“It’s been tough to be the CEO during the pandemic.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“But what I’m really concerned about is who is going to replace him,”</span> Hashimoto said also noting the nationwide search Kaiser is planning. <span class=quotations>“I would prefer someone that understands our community.”</span></p><p>Of the concerns heard, Hashimoto said residents <span class=quotations>“want a hospital that reflects the community.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“I hope they will take that into consideration as they search for a new CEO,”</span> Hashimoto added.</p><p>Said Keith-Agaran: <span class=quotations>“I hope they can find someone familiar with the local and especially Maui Nui healthcare landscape — there remains a lot of work to ensure and improve services in our county.”</span></p><p>* Melissa Tanji can be reached at mtanji@mauinews.com.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX6SaGdqZ52Wwqp5x56YpayYYrCmu4yapaenpaOwpr%2BMoqWtnZ6perW7jKucraGimnq1tMisZKyoop67qHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmaui-health-ceo-announces-intent-to-retire-this-spring-news-sports-jobs.html&text=Maui%20Health%20CEO%20announces%20intent%20to%20retire%20this%20spring%20%7c%20News%2c%20Sports%2c%20Jobs&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaui-health-ceo-announces-intent-to-retire-this-spring-news-sports-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaui-health-ceo-announces-intent-to-retire-this-spring-news-sports-jobs.html&title=Maui%20Health%20CEO%20announces%20intent%20to%20retire%20this%20spring%20%7c%20News%2c%20Sports%2c%20Jobs" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmaui-health-ceo-announces-intent-to-retire-this-spring-news-sports-jobs.html&title=Maui%20Health%20CEO%20announces%20intent%20to%20retire%20this%20spring%20%7c%20News%2c%20Sports%2c%20Jobs" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmaui-health-ceo-announces-intent-to-retire-this-spring-news-sports-jobs.html&title=Maui%20Health%20CEO%20announces%20intent%20to%20retire%20this%20spring%20%7c%20News%2c%20Sports%2c%20Jobs" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaui-health-ceo-announces-intent-to-retire-this-spring-news-sports-jobs.html&description=Maui%20Health%20CEO%20announces%20intent%20to%20retire%20this%20spring%20%7c%20News%2c%20Sports%2c%20Jobs" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-nunn-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Nunn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./martin-shkreli-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Martin Shkreli Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
