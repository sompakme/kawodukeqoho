According to Andy Bayes of property company House Buyer Bureau, buyers are put off by a naff- looking conservatory that is hard to heat – and costs around £2,000 to demolish – and thus, the bureau has calculated, it could knock £15,000 off the value of a house.&nbsp;</p><p>Conservatories took off in the UK in the 1980s as a cost- effective way to add valuable living space to your home, without requiring the sky-high budget of an extension – to the point where almost one in five UK homes had one by the end of the last century. That trend has since reversed, with research by property website Rightmove showing that conservatory building dropped by more than 50 per cent between 2012 and 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>But today, amid a cost of living crisis, and as prices of building materials continue to rise, a conservatory might once more prove an appealing alternative to an extension; particularly as a good one can add up to 5 per cent to a house’s value.&nbsp;</p><p>“Adding a conservatory or orangery to a home can be an effective way of increasing space and extending the functionality of a home without disrupting the existing architectural integrity,” says India Alexander, head of appraisals at estate agencies <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Modern House</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Inigo</a>, which currently has on its books a very desirable house in Lyndhurst Way, London, with not one but two conservatories. “A conservatory or orangery can provide a huge amount of solar gain and light. This is especially beneficial with older homes that traditionally can have low ceilings and dense materials.”&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>This house – for sale with estate agency Inigo – in Lyndhurst Way, London, has not one&nbsp;but two conservatories</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Adam Firman</span></figure><p>A glazed structure can be the most sympathetic way to extend the living space of a period property, agrees James Watchorn of Vale Garden Houses (valegardenhouses.co.uk). “Brick-built extensions form an often bulky and heavy visual that is not necessarily compatible with a lot of period homes. The beauty of timber orangeries and conservatories is that they provide a transparent living area that breaks down the barriers between home and garden.”</p><p>The question is how to build one that will last the distance and add to your home’s usability and appeal, rather than detract from its value.&nbsp;</p><p>“The most important thing to consider when adding a conservatory or orangery is how it works with the building,” continues India. “When it comes to historic homes, it’s important that the materials used are sensitively selected to be complementary to the space.&nbsp;</p><p>“When adding a conservatory to a modern house, it should still be thoughtfully implemented and considered; however, interesting designs can&nbsp;work well if there is synergy with the original&nbsp;design.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Let there be light</h2><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>A sense of history: Roe researched period properties before installing her Oxfordshire orangery</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: CHRIS HORWOOD</span></figure><p>Louise Roe found an orangery brought a touch of airy Californian style to her Oxfordshire home</p><p>When fashion journalist and homeware designer Louise Roe and her husband moved back to the UK from LA just over three years ago, they bought and renovated a country house in Oxfordshire, adding an elegant orangery to the rear – a nod to the light-filled living spaces they had enjoyed in California, but with a traditional British twist.</p><p>“I was nervous about adding to an old house, as I wanted to stay true to its roots and how it was originally intended, but there was an area at the back of the kitchen that was almost crying out for an extra room, some kind of sunroom or conservatory,” she says. “I was aware conservatories often don’t look that nice, so it was important that it was designed in a way that looked as if it had always been there.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Light lunch: the antique furniture completes the period effect</span></figure><p>After researching historic conservatories, orangeries and greenhouses at&nbsp;National Trust properties and the Chelsea Physic Garden, she decided on a Victorian-style orangery, which is usually a more solid structure than a conservatory, and thus would feel “more like a room than an add-on”. It was built by Vale Garden Houses, where prices for a small orangery start from around £50,000 plus VAT.&nbsp;</p><p>Roe had it painted in a period-style sage green and, inspired by pictures of Cecil Beaton’s orangery at Reddish House, filled it with plants and a mix of rattan furniture and antiques, appropriate to its traditional style.</p><p>In the summer of 2021, Roe and her family relocated to London, and settled on a house with an existing conservatory opening off the back of the kitchen, which for them was part of the appeal. “It’s not as beautiful as the orangery in our old house, but it’s still a lovely way to extend the room and get lots of sunlight in,” Roe says: her future plans might include altering the beams and windows for a more traditional look, similar to her Oxfordshire orangery.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">An appropriate addition</h2><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Light fantastic: fashion and interiors designer Jessica Horton loves the orangery she added to the back of her Victorian home in Stratford, east London</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Clara Molden</span></figure><p>Jessica Horton felt extending her Victorian home would be inauthentic, so opted for an orangery</p><p>Designer Jessica Horton and her husband inherited a badly made, run-down uPVC conservatory off&nbsp;the kitchen when they bought their Victorian terrace house in east London. They recently replaced it with a wood-framed orangery at a cost of just under £50,000 – not cheap, but less than half&nbsp;the price of a full side return extension, which would have cost more than&nbsp;£100,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Budget was not their sole consideration, however. “The old conservatory was such an eyesore, but it was so light, so although we couldn’t enjoy the space as it was, we understood that it could be something quite beautiful if it was done right,” says Horton.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m a real appreciator of the layout of Victorian houses so, for me, a full side return extension wouldn’t have felt authentic. Also, we had already renovated our living and dining rooms, and put in double doors leading out to the garden from the dining room via the side return, which we use a lot, and which lets a lot of light into the living room. If we’d done a side return extension, we’d have lost that.”</p><p>When it came to the look, she had a clear idea: “I didn’t want it to look like it was attached to the back of a pub.” After much research, she decided on a simplified version of a Victorian orangery with a Shaker-style twist. Rather than being a lean-to, it has a dark-coloured hardwood frame and a pitched roof, so that the beams frame and elongate the view&nbsp;of the garden as you look out from the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>A sense of space:&nbsp;Horton in the hardwood-framed room, a simplified version of a Victorian orangery with a Shaker-style twist</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Clara Molden</span></figure><p>“The roof is higher than the ceiling in the kitchen, so when you step into the orangery you get that sense of height, and you get all the light going into the kitchen too,” says Horton. “We’ve got double doors from both sides, so you can open the doors into the garden and also into the side return. What I really enjoy about it is the sense of feeling engulfed by the garden. We’ve got climbers growing all the way down the side of the fence, and it’s so green and lush; having that wall of greenery all around makes the kitchen feel at one with the garden.”&nbsp;</p><p>Working with the existing footings of the previous conservatory saved on the cost of digging foundations, which would have added an extra £7,000 or so, but did limit the size of the interior to nine square metres, so the orangery has a panelled wood base (rather than the classic brick base that most have), to maximise the space inside.&nbsp;</p><p>Horton is in the process of installing underfloor heating, but thanks to the double glazing, the orangery has so far been warm enough to use, even on some of the colder days of the past couple of months. Once the weather warms up, there is a window that opens in the roof to help with ventilation.</p><p>Horton intends to install a pantry cupboard in the orangery, along with a small round table and banquette seating, so it can be used as a breakfast room and for working from home: “Although we’ve not finished decorating it yet, since we’ve had the space I find myself in there all the time because it’s so light,” she says. “It’s like being in the garden.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Three other renovations that will add value to your home</h2><p>Ditching a bedroom may seem like a massive no-no, but using that space to create an additional bathroom is actually worthwhile. Here are some surprising revamps that could boost your house price</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">An extra bathroom</h2><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>An en suite or a downstairs lavatory can boost a home’s desirability</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Darren Chung</span></figure><p>Adding an en suite to a bedroom or a downstairs lavatory under the stairs will boost your home’s desirability. In a bigger house, you can even sacrifice a bedroom. “If you have six bedrooms and two are small, maximise that space and convert a bedroom into a bathroom,” says Jemma Scott, partner at the Buying Solution, the&nbsp;buying arm of estate agency Knight Frank. And&nbsp;when it comes to design, “showers over baths are OK for secondary&nbsp;bedrooms, but&nbsp;a&nbsp;big no-no for master suites.” The above one is by Wolfe Interiors and BC Designs.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Built-in storage</h2><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Built-in storage has become a key selling point</span></figure><p>While some are wary of adding cupboards for fear of&nbsp;reducing a room’s flexibility, built-in storage has become a key selling point that is “a game changer for London or country homes”, according to Jemma&nbsp;Scott of the Buying Solution. As with any project, the quality of the work will determine how much value it will add. Make sure fitted wardrobes (such as the above ones by Neatsmith) are designed to maximise the space and are well made – any&nbsp;poorly made built-in furniture that needs to be ripped out and replaced might put off potential buyers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">An extra room</h2><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>An extra room can add value to your home</span></figure><p>A garage conversion or a garden building, will add, respectively, up to 10 per cent or 7.5 per cent to the value of your home, according to research by estate agents Barrows & Forrester. “Look for local properties that have the feature you’re considering adding and find out the value of that home compared to yours,” says James Forrester. “From there, shop around contractors and service providers to find the most reasonable price. The worst thing you can do is embark on a major project on a whim without thorough research.” The above example is by Into the Garden Room.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">.. and three that might devalue it</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">OTT decor</h2><p>“In my experience, it is often&nbsp;the ‘over the top’ things not done properly, or&nbsp;‘overly personalised’ features which end up devaluing a home and being&nbsp;a waste of money,” says Mark Lawson, a partner at the Buying Solution. Very pricey, flashy kitchens are a&nbsp;good example of how you can put out a lot of expense on something that may not be to a future buyer’s taste.</p><p>“I have had clients rip out a&nbsp;brand new kitchen that cost more than £150,000 to put in, because it was too ‘bling’,” he says. “Kitchens and bathrooms are very personal.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Too much modernisation</h2><p>Stripping away period features in favour of a more modern look could also devalue your home; original architectural elements such as coving, picture rails, fireplaces and wooden windows are sought after by those in search of traditional properties, who might be put off by the thought of having to reinstate them.&nbsp;</p><p>Property experts agree that the best approach is to restore any original flooring, fireplaces and mouldings, rather than replacing them, and to replace wooden-framed windows like for like, instead of swapping them for cheaper uPVC.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Expensive extras</h2><p>An outdoor pool may seem a desirable luxury, but it could be an off-putting feature owing to the maintenance it requires and the cost of heating it, particularly given current energy prices. “Outdoor features like swimming pools may not always be a hit with potential buyers,” cautions Simon Barry at agency Harrods Estates.&nbsp;</p><p>“We had a buyer who&nbsp;thought an outdoor pool&nbsp;was an eyesore and a pain to maintain. It’s always an issue selling an older house with a pool – we find a lot of sellers don’t actually use their pools, or the leisure areas around them.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">For sale</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Guests Farmhouse - Shaftesbury, Dorset&nbsp;</h2><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Guests Farmhouse has an orangery with idyllic views</span></figure><p>£2.75m, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Strutt and Parker</a></p><p>This four-bedroom farmhouse, with a separate three-bedroom cottage, has a wood-framed orangery offering idyllic views.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">The Old Farm House - Banbury, Oxfordshire</h2><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Old Farm House has a conservatory with garden views</span></figure><p>£1.35m, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Savills</a></p><p>The conservatory off the kitchen of this 17th-century stone farmhouse houses a sunny dining room with views of the extensive garden.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Do you have a conservatory or are you planning to build one?
