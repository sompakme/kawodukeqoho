"Good taste is death," she once famously said. "Vulgarity is life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Quant did not like clothes as they were in the 1950s. She saw the tight, corseted silhouettes popularized by high fashion houses like Dior as too limiting. They didn't make sense for young women coming of age in the second wave of feminism. Instead, Quant wanted clothes that reflected the pleasure of being alive. When she couldn't find that in stores, she decided to make it herself with fabrics bought from Harrods.</p><img alt="huty23231 019" title="Mary Quant" width=5264 height=3571 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-965440370-6438537a19afa.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Evening Standard</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shortly after graduating from art school, Quant and her then-boyfriend Alexander Plunket Greene opened a boutique, Bazaar, in the heart of London's Chelsea neighborhood. According to her 1966 autobiography, Quant on Quant, she filled it with “a bouillabaisse of clothes and accessories.” There were pleated miniskirts, Peter-Pan collar tops, and shift dresses in bold patterns, often worn with bright candy-colored tights. Women from all over London flocked to the store, not simply for the clothing but also the experience, which was entirely unlike anything they'd experienced at other couturiers and department stores. Whereas those felt mature and stuffy, Mary Quant's boutique felt electric. It offered loud music, free drinks, and a window display filled with mannequins with bob haircuts and sharp cheekbones strumming guitars.</p><img alt="mary quant, clothes designer, standing inside the window of her fashion shop bazaar, seen here with several manikins wearing her designs that are for sale mary's shop is in the brompton road, knightsbridge,london, sw1, 14th october 1960 photo by cyril maitlandmirrorpixgetty images" title="Mary Quant" width=4832 height=4760 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-871157236-643853950f3d5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mirrorpix</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ten years later, Mary Quant was a major global brand, making high fashion for the masses. In <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVN8SzDRVgo" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a 1985 interview on Thames TV" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a 1985 interview on Thames TV</a>, the host cited a recent National Opinion Poll in the UK that found 37% of women had heard of Pierre Cardin, 57% had heard of Yes Saint Laurent, but over 90% knew Mary Quant. When she traveled to the United States to showcase her latest collections, she was mobbed by fans like a pop star and needed extensive security detail. Eventually there was a Mary Quant line at J.C. Penney, Mary Quant makeup with false eyelashes you could buy by the yard, and Mary Quant bedsheets embroidered with her signature rounded daisy logo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her aesthetic helped usher in the "Youthquake" of the 1960s. Daringly short mini skirts and shift dresses became Quant's trademark, and were popularized by models Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton. But Quant didn't have to rely on famous women wearing her clothes. Some might even argue that Twiggy and Shrimpton's status as style icons had less to do with them and more to do with how incredible they looked wearing Mary Quant. She was one of the first true celebrity designers, who sold her aesthetic of eccentric British poshness because she epitomized it herself with her Vidal Sassoon five-point bob and painted eyes. She even wore one of her own mini dresses to receive her Order of the British Empire in 1966 at Buckingham Palace. Who wouldn't want to be that woman?</p><img alt="english fashion designer and fashion icon mary quant, wearing wool jersey mini skirted dress and beret, holds her obe with her business partner and husband, british entrepreneur alexander plunket greene 1932 1990, and the chairman of mary quant fashion brand, british entrepreneur archie mcnair 1919 2015, at buckingham palace, london, uk, 15th november 1966 photo by central presshulton archivegetty images" title="Quant At Palace" width=4796 height=4800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1204208148-643856e2e7562.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Central Press</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p>But of course, Quant was more than a great haircut or a maker of great clothes. She was a liberator of women who helped them realize they should wear what they want to do whatever they pleased. Like her distinct mannequins, her clothing emphasized the importance of movement, inspired by the outfits she wore to dance classes as a child.</p><img alt="english fashion designer and fashion icon mary quant at the launch of her new range of neckwear, her first menswear collection, at the savoy hotel, london, uk, 12th september 1972 she is wearing silky bomber jacket, white shirt and polka dotted necktie photo by hulton archivegetty images" title="Mary Quant's Neckwear Collection Launch" width=4735 height=4800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mary-quant-643853afcc82f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Central Press</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the spring of 2019, when the Victoria & Albert Museum held a retrospective of her work, curators included a montage featuring thousands of women sharing photos and stories of their favorite Mary Quant pieces. You could make memories in her clothes, not just because of how they photographed but because of how they made you feel. “The fashionable woman wears clothes,” she once said. “The clothes don't wear her.” She was an expert in personal style before it became a 2023 buzzword.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the 1985 Thames TV interview, Quant also mused, “Fashion is about life. It’s about everything...I think fashion anticipates. It seems to get there first and everything unravels behind it.” Quant was also there first, and the viral mini skirts of today certainly wouldn't have been possible without her.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Mary Quant: Life in Photos</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="november 1965 chelsea fashion designer and make up manufacturer mary quant photo by keystonegetty images" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3165261-643857528c4ae.jpeg title="Mary Quant" width=3727 height=2743 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
