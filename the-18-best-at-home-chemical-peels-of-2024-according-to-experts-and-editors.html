"Look at the acids in the peel, and make sure they target the issue you are trying to remedy," Dr. Engelman says. For example, someone with acne-prone skin might want to seek out a salicylic acid peel, while someone with sensitive skin looking to target hyperpigmentation is better suited with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/glycolic-acid-benefits/>glycolic acid.</a></p><ul><li><strong>Strength of Acid&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel recommends that companies use glycolic and lactic alpha-hydroxy acids in concentrations of 10 percent or less, in solutions with a pH of 3.5 or greater, when formulating consumer products. As for salicylic acid? Two percent is the maximum concentration in over-the-counter products.</p><p>You're going to notice that the best at-home chemical peels on this list range from peel pads to overnight treatments. While the version you choose is in large part personal preference, it's worth noting that short-term, wash-off products will typically have less of an impact than leave-on formulas that can work overnight. However, the latter is necessarily better. Wash-off products are generally ideal for more sensitive or dry skin types.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-is-an-at-home-chemical-peel-safe><span>Is an At-Home Chemical Peel Safe?</span></h2><p>First, a reminder: Using a professional-grade product at home is unsafe. Those high intensity acids should only be used by doctors.</p><p>“Due to a wave of how-to YouTube videos and consumer accessibility and professional products available through vendors like Amazon, I am seeing more and more instances of serious damage done to skin—all in a patient's own bathroom," says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dennisgrossmd.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Dennis Gross</a>, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare. "Higher concentrations of acid must be administered by a licensed professional; they can damage skin if they're not neutralized properly." That said, <strong>using a peel pad, mask, or serum specifically designed for at-home use is a-OK</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-at-home-chemical-peels><span>The Best At-Home Chemical Peels</span></h2><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tr2EPcJMtvxVuGaJwDz4NH-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best At-Home Chemical Peel Overall</span></p><p>Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel</p><p>Chances are, you've seen Dr. Dennis Gross' peel pad before.

It's packed with five different acids—a combination of AHAs and BHAs—to target concerns ranging from acne to dark spots and dry patches. For the two-minute long application process alone, it's well worth the investment.&nbsp;That said, these pads are the real deal, so if you have sensitive or dry skin, don't charge full speed ahead. Start out using them just two times a week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> AHAs and BHAs; Multi-benefit</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Might be too intense for some</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"This product has been amazing in clearing up my face. It's so smooth after each treatment and you can really see all the gook on the pad even after it's been washed. I have seen a significant improvement on my smile lines. They are not as defined and seem to be smoothing out. This is way better than scrubs or harsh cleansing tools. It's the perfect amount of exfoliation.

If you do want to smooth out some of that texture, though, there’s no better product than Kate Somerville's. In addition to glycolic acid, the formula includes <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22777936/what-is-retinol/>retinol</a> and <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a37673230/niacinamide-benefits/>niacinamide</a>, two ingredients that speed up cell turnover and help even skin texture and tone.

I generally don't have sensitive skin, so I started using it about twice per week all over my face and neck, but I noticed some dry skin and peeling on my cheeks after a little while of using it. Since then, I've reduced use to once per week, and I'm very satisfied with the results. My skin is smoother and is more even in tone. The product is kind of sticky once applied, but I found waiting about 20-30 minutes for it to dry/set in before going to bed helps." –Sephora</p><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WvrbaGhtS9Cnpfv9mz2zsH-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best At-Home Chemical Peel for Acne-Prone Skin</span></p><p>Alpyn Beauty Wild Huckleberry 8-Acid Polishing Peel</p><p>If you’re ready to pull out the big guns in the name of glow, this product is the way to go.
