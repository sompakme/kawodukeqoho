In a clip shared on Instagram, she seemingly addresses the negativity coming from her ex. She's also sure to note that she's personally "so proud" of who she raised. “The point of every negative situation, whether it’s an illness whether it’s a fool that you have to deal with because they keep entering your life when you are no longer giving any more energy to it, is to only keep you down to where they thought they had you because they were the author of an <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">extremely abusive situation emotionally, mentally</a>," she explained. "And they’re no good at not being the center of attention anymore.
