Before appearing as Elle's critical but encouraging law professor, Holland Taylor appeared on a range of projects from NBC's "Saved By the Bell: The College Years" to Fox's "Ally McBeal."<h2>Did Elle Woods graduate with honors?</h2>After winning the trial and proving Brooke's innocence, Warner tries to reconcile with Elle but she rejects him. Elle graduated with high honors, was the class-elected speaker at the ceremony, and has been invited into one of Boston's best law firms.<h2>Why is Reese Witherspoon's hair different at the end of Legally Blonde?</h2>Legally Blonde hinged on Witherspoon's iconic golden locks, but she no longer had the same hair after filming a movie in England. It was red. On top of that, she suddenly had freckles that were not present in the previous scenes. As such, Witherspoon had to sport a wig to keep up with the continuity.<h2>Legally Blonde (7/11) Movie CLIP - Impressing Professor Callahan (2001) HD</h2><p></p><h2>What happened to Callahan in Legally Blonde?</h2>Professor Callahan had a bad ending at the end of the movie. He was not only fired by Harvard for harassing Elle, but his reputation as a lawyer is ruined, his ex-wife takes everything from him, and is sent to jail where he's roommates with Enrique.<h2>Who does Elle Woods end up with?</h2>She becomes engaged to Emmett Richmond at the end of Legally Blonde on her graduation night and they get married during the events of Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde.<h2>Does Elle Woods become a lawyer?</h2>Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a sorority girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III by getting a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard Law School, and in the process, overcomes stereotypes against blondes and triumphs as a successful lawyer through unflappable self-confidence and fashion/beauty ...<h2>What did Elle Woods get on her LSAT?</h2>In the film, Elle scored a 179 on her LSAT. That is one point away from a perfect score of 180. This means she scored in the 90th overall percentile. The average student's LSAT score is a 150.<h2>How old is Callahan in Legally Blonde?</h2>Professor Callahan (Stage Age 40-60) A self-important and manipulative law professor at Harvard. He objectifies Elle.<h2>Why does Elle Woods decide to go to Washington DC?</h2>Woods decides to go to Washington to lobby for a prevention of testing on animals bill. Whether Washington DC is seen as the white town of its marble monuments or the more grey town of corruption, graft and logrolling, Ms. Woods approaches it in her definitive pink.<h2>Who is the masked man in Big Hero 6?</h2>Yokai is the silent masked man behind the terrible tragedy that strikes San Fransokyo, turning Hiro's world upside down. As a result, Hiro transforms a group of nerds into a team of high-tech crime fighters—Big Hero 6—with one mission: Track down Yokai and bring him to justice.<h2>What did Michelle Obama get on the LSAT?</h2>Unraveling the secret behind Obama's LSAT Score<p>Hence it's very likely that Obama had an LSAT Score around the median of the class (43 on the then-used 48 point scale).</p><h2>Is a 162 a good LSAT score?</h2>From your raw scores, the test is graded on an LSAT score scale from 120-180. The average LSAT score is about 150. To get into a top 14 law school, you need to score above 162, and to get into a top 50 law school, you need 154 or above.<h2>Does Elle end up with Warner?</h2>First things first, Elle does not end up with Warner. Even though he starts to see her more appealing when she excels above and beyond expectations in their law classes, Elle doesn't even entertain going back to the man who broke up with her because of his own insecurities.<h2>Does Legally Blonde hold up?</h2>This time, Mindy Kaling is penning the film, writing Elle as she might be some 20 years on from where we first met her. And, while fashion and trends may have moved on (and dated jokes fallen by the wayside), I have no doubt that the enduring ethos of Legally Blonde will hold strong.<h2>Does Elle marry Emmett?</h2>Elle and Emmett get married in a park in D.C., albeit not at Fenway Park as they had planned, but standing on the home plate which has been delivered to D.C. by Paulette's husband.<h2>Do Elle and Vivian get together?</h2>Alas, Elle and Vivian never got to be a queer power couple. The film ends with Elle and Vivian turning from enemies to best friends, and Elle and Emmett (Luke Wilson) together. In the sequel, Emmett and Elle are married and, while Elle is close to Vivian still, Vivian isn't part of the movie.<h2>Do Elle and Vivian become friends?</h2>Vivienne Kensington was the ex-fiancée of Warner Huntington III and become friends with Elle Woods at the end in Legally Blonde. She was not seen after the first movie.<h2>Does Elle Woods get assaulted?</h2>As progressive as Legally Blonde's sexual politics were 17 years ago, one aspect of the film's #MeToo material that I hope we've left behind in 2001 is how unfazed Callahan is after hitting on Elle. His is the demeanor of a man who has behaved this way before and knows how it will shake out.<h2>What did Kim Kardashian get on the LSAT?</h2>Did Kim Fail the LSAT? luisjosé. In a clip from the show, Kim reveals to sisters Kourtney and Khloe that she failed the test on a relatively close score of 474.<h2>Can you pass the LSAT without studying?</h2>From our independent research, we've found that students who take the LSAT without studying achieve scores between 145-153. Scoring for the LSAT is scaled. This essentially means the number of questions you answered correctly will be compared to the other students who took the exam at the same time.<h2>Is 3.8 A good GPA for law school?</h2>However, among the highest-ranked law schools, the norm is to admit people with near-perfect college grades. All of the top-10 law schools had median GPAs of 3.7 or higher. Seven of these 10 schools had a median GPA that was at least a 3.8, and among those three had a median GPA that was a 3.9 or above.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNrGStp12lv7CyxKyqqKpdmK6tuMChmKc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-professor-callahan.html&text=What%20happens%20to%20Professor%20Callahan%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happens-to-professor-callahan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-professor-callahan.html&title=What%20happens%20to%20Professor%20Callahan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-professor-callahan.html&title=What%20happens%20to%20Professor%20Callahan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-professor-callahan.html&title=What%20happens%20to%20Professor%20Callahan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happens-to-professor-callahan.html&description=What%20happens%20to%20Professor%20Callahan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eric-clapton-lay-down-sally-lyric.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Eric Clapton                                          Lay Down Sally lyric">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wale-miguel-congratulate-each-other-on-respective-grammy-nominations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wale &amp;amp; Miguel Congratulate Each Other On Respective Grammy Nominations">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
