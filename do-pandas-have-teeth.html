There, we present three cases of giant panda attacks on humans at the Panda House at Beijing Zoo from September 2006 to June 2009 to warn people of the giant panda's potentially dangerous behavior.<h2>Are pandas aggressive or friendly?</h2>Pandas are known to be aggressive when threatened and have strong teeth and jaws like most bears.

The reason for this is that they don't have sufficient milk or energy to care for two cubs.<h2>Why are pandas so clumsy?</h2>Because they spend lots of their day lazing about or climbing, their leg muscles aren't nearly as strong as their forearms. When they do actually move, they can't rely as heavily on their legs. It's not so surprising then that they're a bit clumsy, with how unevenly developed they are.<h2>Why do pandas not mate?</h2>The problem with pandas<p>Female pandas only ovulate once a year for a short period of time, so male pandas have to detect this quickly to successfully conceive. Male pandas can also struggle with how to actually mount a female for breeding, which also reduces how much time they have to breed.</p><h2>How long does a panda live?</h2>Scientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it is shorter than lifespans in zoos.
