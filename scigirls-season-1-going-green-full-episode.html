number 5 plastics is that they are not recyclable in our county.</p><p>I think it's kind of surprising because I know it's plastic, but I just don't get why.</p><p>They must have some reason.</p><p>It

question about all these different numbers at the bottom, can you tell us about that?</p><p>There are a lot of different types of plastic, and they're used for a lot of different things.</p><p>The scientific name for a plastic is a polymer.</p><p>How many numbers of plastics are there?</p><p>There are 1 through 7.</p><p>7 is generally not recyclable.</p><p>Do the numbers matter?</p><p>The numbers matter as far as it tells you what type of plastic it is.</p><p>Like you discovered, number 5 is polypropylene.</p><p>(Peri) Alexis kind of helped to explain, she said all the different numbers have different properties, like their melting point and all the different characteristics, which lead into what kind of plastics they are.</p><p>If number 5s are not recyclable, some of them aren't, why do they even use them?</p><p>One of the main reasons that number 5 is used in industry for things like yogurt cups is because they can make the walls of it really thin, and it'll still be durable enough to hold the product.</p><p>And the cups are lighter, so it helps out as far as shipping goes.</p><p>Unfortunate that they use it despite the fact that a lot of recycling centers don't take it.</p><p>How did you decide you wanted to do this?</p><p>As a chemical engineer there are so many different things you can do.</p><p>When I was in college I was just really attracted to the food industry.</p><p>I got really interested in the packaging.</p><p>Then as I started to learn more and more how much you can do with it, and you're really affecting how consumers view your

were showing Alexis our prototype, she gave us some tips about how the whole thing should be made.</p><p>So let's talk about some of these design considerations.</p><p>Somebody explain to me the purpose of the tinfoil.</p><p>The tinfoil is to make sure none of the dirt comes out or the soil from spilling out when we're packaging it.</p><p>Because of the holes in the lid, right?</p><p>If you put holes in the lid, what if the water evaporates and dries off the seed?</p><p>So maybe we should just not put any water in.</p><p>Or do you really need the holes in the lid, because that adds an extra step.</p><p>If you water it, then not having holes in the lid will keep the moisture in.</p><p>Our designs, we thought that they would work until Alexis told us we have to think about the steps and what's going to happen if we do certain things.</p><p>Another thing that will speed up your process would be, figure out how many of each specific seed you want to make, and then you can preprint the labels so that you don't have to write what it is on there each time.</p><p>Just print more labels with the directions on it and stick those right on the back.</p><p>The name of the product, I love it!</p><p>The only thing I recommend is putting what it actually is.</p><p>(Allie) Seed Starting Kit.</p><p>(Alexis) Right.</p><p>So that needs to be on here too.</p><p>And we need to get the names of the different seeds on here.</p><p>Could your label be spiced up a little bit?</p><p>When we were brainstorming, she helped us take things into consideration like what would people like to use?</p><p>What was recyclable?</p><p>Because that would make people want to buy it.</p><p>What if there was a competitor that was the same thing as ours?</p><p>What would make us different?</p><p>And we want our label to pop out.</p><p>(Alexis) I have a friend who works at a plant store, a place where they sell things like this.</p><p>They said they'd be willing to do a little trial for us.</p><p>So cool.</p><p>But they need 200 by Friday.</p><p>I'm really excited that Alexis did that for us.</p><p>I mean, she obviously really cares that we're going to try and help the environment.</p><p>It's a good opportunity, but we really need to get to work.</p><p>No more playin' around.</p><p>But can we do it?</p><p>(all) Yes!</p><p>Yes!</p><p>It's go time!</p><p>♪ ♪ (Peri) Right now, we are revising our label, making it a little more neater, colorful.</p><p>(Mackenzie) On Friday, we are going to be selling them at our local garden shop.</p><p>It's really exciting!</p><p>(Peri) There's also a lot of pressure because we gotta make 200 of these and make them look neat, not kind of cheap!</p><p>I think it was a good idea to add directions on the label so you know how to take care of a plant.</p><p>(Allie) We're just going to finish off the day with as much as we can get done.</p><p>(Izzie) Here's Peri's profile.</p><p>My name is Peri, and this is my house.</p><p>This is Puffy.</p><p>This is my bunny.</p><p>This is my room.</p><p>It is very pink because I like pink.</p><p>This is my soccer trophy, basketball trophy, gymnastics, volleyball trophy.</p><p>I like a lot of athletic stuff.</p><p>This is a picture of me and my brother.</p><p>I also have a sewing machine because I like sewing.</p><p>Thank you for coming.</p><p>Bye!</p><p>We're about to start selling our Seed Starter Kits.</p><p>We decided for the money that half of it will be going to our recycling center, and the other half will be going to Pennies for Patients, which is for kids with leukemia or lymphoma.</p><p>♪ ♪ Would you be interested in our Simply Eco Seed Starter Kit?</p><p>No thank you.</p><p>♪ ♪ There was a lot of people, and we were kind of bored a little bit because we're like come on, we just want to get started, and then...</p><p>I'll take 3.</p><p>There you are.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>This morning it was a little rough because we weren't very comfortable with going up to them.</p><p>Then we kind of revised our catch phrases, which really helped us reel them in.</p><p>Would you be interested in just looking at our Seed Starter Kit?</p><p>I would like to tell you about our Seed Starter Kit.</p><p>You guys did this yourself?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>For only a dollar--they're going to a very good cause.</p><p>All you have to do is add water, the directions are on the back.</p><p>They're all made out of recycled material.</p><p>3 of them for $2.</p><p>(woman) I'll take a cumin.</p><p>(man) Why don't we get 6 of them?</p><p>(woman) I'll take one of each.</p><p>(SciGirl) Thank you.</p><p>(woman) Good luck!</p><p>Thanks guys!</p><p>Hi Alexis!</p><p>Oh, I'm so proud.</p><p>Oh, I need a hug!</p><p>How's business going?</p><p>Great.</p><p>Pretty good.</p><p>Their project has come a long way.</p><p>It looks like it's going really well.</p><p>They're very good saleswomen.</p><p>You're a good sales,

going to take chives.</p><p>I'll take a sage.</p><p>Today, we got to actually sell our product, and it was just really fun.</p><p>We did really well.</p><p>Right now, we're at the recycling association.</p><p>We're just about to go into Ellen's office and give her our presentation.</p><p>All right girls, I'm ready.</p><p>(SciGirls) Hi.</p><p>(Ellen) Hi.</p><p>I'm very excited to see what you came up with.</p><p>This is our Simply Eco Seed Starting Kit.</p><p>The reason why we made this, we did a trash sort at my school, and we found a lot of number 5 plastics.</p><p>We thought to ourselves we could do something instead of throwing these away.</p><p>Our ideas were to make a flowerpot.</p><p>What's in our container would be the seeds, some water, some compost and soil.</p><p>We came up with many different prototypes.</p><p>We showed all our different prototypes and how it kind of led up to the final prototype, which was really good because we needed to show her where we came from.</p><p>These are our final products... (drumroll) Nice.</p><p>When I revealed our product, Ellen was pretty surprised to see how put together it was.</p><p>This is a sales chart that we made on our total sales.</p><p>After 5 hours, we made $49.</p><p>Thank you for listening to our presentation.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Do you have any questions?</p><p>Well, I have a lot of questions.</p><p>Then she gave us some tips to kind of improve it.</p><p>But it was good because we need some constructive criticism.</p><p>Were you thinking that these Seed Starter Kits would already have the seeds planted?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Well, what if the seed actually sprouted?</p><p>Oh!</p><p>Let's open up one of your kits.</p><p>I'm just curious what it looks like on the inside.</p><p>Ellen, she just said we don't want it to sprout.</p><p>That would be terrible.</p><p>This is really interesting.</p><p>Oh, it already started sprouting!</p><p>(Ellen laughs) Okay!</p><p>Wow!</p><p>Yeah!</p><p>We're like, oh no, no, no, no, this is not supposed to happen.</p><p>If you want these to be on a shelf in a store, you probably don't want to preplant them for the individual.</p><p>I actually know of a company that, they go through a lot of little bags, they ended up, they're recycling them.</p><p>But we could do the same thing what we did with the yogurt container and reuse those bags.</p><p>Some other constructive criticism was to mention some other things on our label.</p><p>The materials that we used were postconsumer items.</p><p>I think that if they market the fact that it is 100% postconsumer, they have a niche there that a lot of products don't have.</p><p>"Postconsumer"-- that's it!</p><p>I can help Jake!</p><p>Okay, do you think this is something that can really get going and really happen?</p><p>(Ellen) Oh, absolutely!</p><p>Would we be working with you guys?</p><p>(Ellen) Yeah.</p><p>(SciGirls) Okay.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>I know that this is real, and it's not fake.</p><p>I'm just excited that I'm going to be seeing my product in the stores.</p><p>So I don't know what else to say, but-- wow!</p><p>Well we're very excited to be working with you guys... (SciGirls) Thank you.</p><p>...and creating a market for postconsumer materials.</p><p>It's going to be so exciting to see these on shelves because it's not every day that you get to create a product that's on store shelves.</p><p>Overall it has been a great experience, and we've learned a lot along the way.</p><p>This is it.</p><p>I can feel it!</p><p>I'm a winner!</p><p>Ah!</p><p>No!</p><p>Oh, that's my last one.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Jake?</p><p>That's all the Munchie containers I could get my hands on, and I didn't win.</p><p>Oh, sorry, Jake, but thanks to the SciGirls, we're still going to be able to do something cool with those containers.</p><p>Yeah?</p><p>Cool enough to get me to the premiere?</p><p>Mmm... maybe.</p><p>(Izzie laughs) I cannot believe we found a way to use all those Munchie containers.</p><p>I can't believe you got me a ticket to the premiere.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>Well, I just sent them the photo, and they said you had to be here.</p><p>I totally had to be here to see (both) Subterranean Smackdown!</p><p>Ha-ha!</p><p>So sweet!</p><p>Whoo-hoo!</p><p>Allie, Mackenzie, and I made up a song.</p><p>♪ Everywhere we go, Everywhere we go, ♪ ♪ People want to know, People want to know, ♪ ♪ Why we recycle, Why we recycle.</p><p>♪ ♪ So we showed them, So we showed them, ♪ ♪ We recycle, We recycle.</p><p>♪ Re... mix!</p><p>♪ We recycle, yes we do, ♪ ♪ If you don't, What's wrong with you?</p><p>♪ ♪ We recycle, Yes we do.</p><p>♪ ♪ Fixing trash, Recycling's cool!</p><p>♪ Word!</p><p>Yea!</p><p>(SciGirls) Our investigation is about rescue robots.</p><p>We wanted to give the robot human personality traits.</p><p>(electronic male voice) Hello SciGirls.</p><p>(all) Robots!</p><p>We went stargazing, and we couldn't see many stars.</p><p>Light pollution is actually a really big environmental problem.</p><p>Star party!</p><p>(laughter) Let's scuba!</p><p>We both became interested in the health of the reefs, and it became this full-on investigation.</p><p>I used to think being a scientist was wearing a lab coat.</p><p>It's going to be really cool.</p><p>(Izzy) Major funding for "SciGirls" is provided by the National Science Foundation-- supporting education and research across all fields of science and engineering.</p><p>The National Science Foundation-- where discoveries begin!</p><p>(woman) Additional funding is provided by ExxonMobil.</p><p>♪ ♪ Hey there!</p><p>Hi!</p><p>The "SciGirls" Website is off the hook!</p><p>You can set up a profile, find new friends, create a page for your science project, watch "SciGirls" videos, and have fun!</p><p>So come on-- be a SciGirl on pbskidsgo.org See you there!</p><p>Bye!</p><p>(girls) ♪ S-C-I-G-I-R-L-S CC--Armour Captioning & TPT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2BrtqWxzmiqnKGXnr%2Btv4ytp61ll6S2r7OMoKmenZ5is7a4y2acqaGjpLGmew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fscigirls-season-1-going-green-full-episode.html&text=SciGirls%20%7c%20Season%201%20%7c%20Going%20Green%20-%20Full%20Episode&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscigirls-season-1-going-green-full-episode.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscigirls-season-1-going-green-full-episode.html&title=SciGirls%20%7c%20Season%201%20%7c%20Going%20Green%20-%20Full%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fscigirls-season-1-going-green-full-episode.html&title=SciGirls%20%7c%20Season%201%20%7c%20Going%20Green%20-%20Full%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fscigirls-season-1-going-green-full-episode.html&title=SciGirls%20%7c%20Season%201%20%7c%20Going%20Green%20-%20Full%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscigirls-season-1-going-green-full-episode.html&description=SciGirls%20%7c%20Season%201%20%7c%20Going%20Green%20-%20Full%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./scott-coker-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scott Coker Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
