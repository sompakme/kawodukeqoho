Joel's Character Was Inspired From <b>Llewelyn Moss</b> Character.</span></span><h2>Is Joel from The Last of Us a real person?</h2>Joel is played by voice actor Troy Baker, whose voice many game fans might recognize. Baker has a very long list of acting credits that includes some fan-favorite games, not to mention voice acting gigs in some pretty notable TV shows as well.<h2>Who is Ellie modeled after?</h2>Once heavily modelled on Juno actress Ellen Page, the new Ellie has now lost her freckles and gained a different shaped nose. The fresh scenes see Ellie and accomplice Joel encounter another survivor, who turns out to be less than friendly.<h2>Who is the face model for Ellie in Last of Us?</h2>She is portrayed by Ashley Johnson through motion capture and voice acting; in the upcoming television adaptation, she will be portrayed by Bella Ramsey.<h2>Who is Abby modeled after last of us?</h2>Abby's face was modeled on Jocelyn Mettler, while her body was based on Colleen Fotsch. The character of Abby was well-received by critics, with many noting that her redemption arc was believable and made the character likable by the game's end.<h2>Joel Miller (The Last of Us): The Story You Never Knew | Treesicle</h2><p></p><h2>Who was Dina from Last of Us 2 based off of?</h2>Cascina Caradonna, the person who provided the face model for Dina in The Last of Us 2, has an emotional reaction to seeing herself in the game. While some have criticized those involved in the production of The Last of Us 2, it's hard to deny the wholesomeness of a recent moment shared on YouTube.<h2>Will there be last of us 3?</h2>Speaking in April 2021, Neil Druckmann, Creative Director of Part II, did officially confirmed that he has penned a story outline for a third game.<h2>Why did they change Ellie's face?</h2>Creative director, Neil Druckman explained the change to IGN: "After delving further into the game's narrative over the past few months, we decided to modify Ellie's model to better reflect [actress] Ashley [Johnson]'s personality, and also resemble a slightly younger teen more fitting to the story.<h2>What happened to Joel's wife?</h2>However, Sarah was fatally hit. Despite Joel's efforts, she died in his arms.<h2>What race is Dina in Last of Us 2?</h2>One cool thing that The Last Of Us 2 has been praised for is their attention to detail when it comes to the background of the characters. The developers paid much attention to traditional Jewish practices, as Dina is a Jewish-American character. She can be seen wearing a Hamsa bracelet in the game.<h2>Is Ellen Page in Last of Us 2?</h2>Actress Ellen Page is not in The Last of Us, no matter how much it might look like she is, and she's lashing out publicly at developer Naughty Dog for "ripping off" her likeness for the game.<h2>Why did Ellie and Joel fall out?</h2>That rift between Joel and Ellie was never able to mend before his passing, and although Joel knew there was a mutual familial love between them, Ellie never had enough time to express that. That lack of closure is as big a reason for her revenge quest, more so than just her hatred.<h2>Is Joel a hero or villain?</h2>Even though Joel acts as one of the main protagonists in the game (and is willing to keep Ellie safe), he still has many traits of a villain, such as selfishness and capacity for extreme violence and brutal murder all in the name of survival.<h2>Is Abby a hero or villain?</h2>Both Joel and Abby are considered protagonist villains, though the latter serves as the antagonist for Ellie's half of the story in The Last of Us: Part II.<h2>Is Joel an anti hero?</h2>Characters, like everyone's favorite anti-hero, Joel. Created in the now-iconic horror survival game The Last Of Us, a game that will very soon make the jump into HBO Max as a series, Joel is a hero to many, a simple man trying to survive in the apocalypse, only doing what he needs to survive and protect Ellie.<h2>Why does Ellie have a scar on her eyebrow?</h2>Ellie develops scars from bite marks and acid burns. As a result, her ex Kat gives her a tattoo to cover them up. The tattoo covers the scars so well that nobody knows she has them.<h2>Does Ellie have PTSD?</h2>Ellie is suffering from PTSD caused by Joel's murder and still believes she needs to kill Abby to move on, then Tommy visits the farm and reveals he may know where Abby and Lev are. Despite Dina asking Ellie to stay, Ellie leaves her behind and sets off for California to try and find Abby.<h2>How old is Abby The Last of Us?</h2>Players have often wondered if Abby was older than Ellie given her massive frame and stature. However, with the information presented in the game and Neil's explanation, it can be deduced that Abby was approximately 20 years old, roughly the same age as Ellie, who is 19 during the events of The Last of Us Part II.<h2>Is Ellie pregnant in The Last of Us 2?</h2>The Last of Us 2 : Dina Tells Ellie She's Pregnant.<h2>Why did Ellie leave the guitar?</h2>For Ellie to move past her need for vengeance and anger over Joel's murder, she needs to leave both the guitar and the watch behind. They're both relics of the past, and the only way for her to finally move forward is to leave them behind.<h2>Why did Ellie let Abby live?</h2>The Reasons Ellie Had For Letting Abby Get Away<p>Abby is weak and vulnerable; she's not the idyllic monster Ellie has in her head of the woman who claimed Joel's life. Then seeing Abby cut down Lev again reminded her of the humanity in Abby.</p><h2>How did Dina get pregnant tlou2?</h2>Near the end of Dina and Jesse's relationship, the two had a sexual encounter that resulted in Dina becoming pregnant with JJ. She revealed her pregnancy to Ellie near the end of their first day in Seattle while they were sheltered inside a theater, thus explaining Dina's recent bouts of sickness.<h2>Does Ellie end up with Dina?</h2>The Last of Us 2 ending recap<p>After Abby leaves Ellie on death's door following a brutal confrontation in Seattle, Ellie returns home to begin a new life with Dina, and we flash forward 18 months later to find the pair raising baby JJ (named in honour of Joel and Jesse) on a farmstead not too far from Jackson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaho2K3sLHLZqSipJyav265zp2cpZ2UYq6nwMSr</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-joel-miller-modeled-after.html&text=Who%20is%20Joel%20Miller%20modeled%20after%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-joel-miller-modeled-after.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-joel-miller-modeled-after.html&title=Who%20is%20Joel%20Miller%20modeled%20after%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-joel-miller-modeled-after.html&title=Who%20is%20Joel%20Miller%20modeled%20after%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-joel-miller-modeled-after.html&title=Who%20is%20Joel%20Miller%20modeled%20after%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-joel-miller-modeled-after.html&description=Who%20is%20Joel%20Miller%20modeled%20after%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-s-in-the-hunt-for-the-studio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whos in the Hunt for the Studio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-causes-the-white-spots-on-sugar-snap-peas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What causes the white spots on sugar snap peas?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
