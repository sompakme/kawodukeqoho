Red and golden handmade beads</h3><p class=align-left>Red is probably the favourite colour among the Nigerian fashionable ladies who like attending ceremonies.

You totally are assured to become the centre of attention if you choose this set of accessories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2emiibocgtpg.jpg><h3>9. Asymmetric bead designs</h3><p class=align-left>The beaded necklaces do not have to be perfectly symmetric. Sometimes you can put together two or more colours and make a mess out of them, and it will work because it will still be a fashionable and trendy mess. For example, some people like mixing dark blue with yellow, but you can try different combinations. You can try blue and gold, black and yellow, red and gold, pink and blue, and other colour conjunctions. Also, it will be a great decision to put darker and lighter shades of the same colour together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ba471ea66eb848f3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>AMVERIFIED: Africa’s indigenous social network community</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7vtapcesffp.jpg><h3>10. Small bead patterned style</h3><p class=align-left>The beads should not be solely huge. Sometimes, the small beads will be an amazing solution and attract everyone's eye no less than big beads. Besides, the small bead techniques involve amazing patterns, like this tiger one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6qbmseirj0n.jpg><p class=align-left>These are fashionable and modern bead designs in Nigeria.
