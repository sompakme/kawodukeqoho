Among the central mysteries of the show is the fate of Cal Stone, a young passenger with a pivotal role in the unfolding events. This article delves into the character’s journey, the twists and turns of his storyline, and the impact of his actions on the overarching narrative of Manifest.</p><table><tr><th>Character</th><th>Description</th><th>Significant Events</th></tr><tr><td>Cal Stone</td><td>Youngest son of the Stone family, passenger on Flight 828</td><td>Disappearance, age jump, connection to the ‘Callings’</td></tr><tr><td>Manifest</td><td>Supernatural drama series</td><td>Focuses on the mystery of Montego Air Flight 828</td></tr></table><h2 id=the-enigma-of-cal-stone-YfzvmzaOyW>The Enigma of Cal Stone</h2><p>Cal Stone, portrayed by Jack Messina for the majority of the series, is the youngest son of Ben and Grace Stone.
