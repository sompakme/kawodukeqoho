Most notably, Iggy Azalea joined <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nicki Minaj</a> as the only other woman in hip-hop to top the charts in the decade at the time. As a result of the success of her single “<a href=# rel>Fancy</a>,” she ended the year as Billboard’s year-end number-one song.&nbsp;Besides these two, featured acts: Rita Ora, Kesha, and Charli XCX enjoyed success on the charts.</p><p>Boundaries were being pushed even further, and the versatile musical palates of rap enthusiasts were introduced to new and exciting sounds. Trap music continued to be a dominant subgenre in rap, with pop collaborations also taking center stage. Furthermore, in 2014, the coveted top spot was claimed by only seven hits. There were also no re-emergences of any songs that year, unlike “Holy Grail” the year prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>7 No. 1 Rap Songs From 2010</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-only-ft-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown>Nicki Minaj - “Only” Ft. Drake, Lil Wayne & <a href=# class=text-word>Chris Brown</a></h2></span><p>“Only” was released in October as the third single from Minaj’s third studio album, The Pinkprint. Young&nbsp;Money alums Minaj, Lil Wayne, and Drake all had experience working together, making for a stellar rap track. As expected, their chemistry was unmistakably evident on the track. Chris Brown, the featured act, blended well with the three rappers. He notably delivered a smooth and memorable hook. Despite criticism and backlash over the song and its lyric video, “Only” further solidified Minaj’s status as one of the leading female rappers in the industry. The track performed well commercially, charting on both the Billboard Hot 100, and the Hot Rap Songs charts. It peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100 chart, and also topped the Hot Rap Songs chart for one week.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>7 No. 1 Rap Songs From 2011</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bobby Shmurda - “Hot N***a”</h2></span><p>“<a href=# rel>Hot N***a</a>” gained widespread attention and popularity through social media platforms like Vine and YouTube. The song, known for its catchy beat and dance, became a viral sensation in 2014. Furthermore, “Hot Boy” was one of the most social media-friendly rap hits of 2014. It was released as the lead single from Shmurda’s debut EP, Shmurda She Wrote. The “Shmoney Dance” featured in the music video quickly became a cultural phenomenon, and largely contributed to the song’s commercial success. It ruled atop the Hot Rap Songs chart for just two weeks, but has had a long-lasting legacy. Despite Shmurda’s long absence from the music scene due to incarceration, “Hot N***a” continued to be heavily streamed. The song made regular appearances at different kinds of events.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>7 No. 1 Rap Songs From 2012</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Iggy Azalea - “Black Widow” Ft. Rita Ora</h2></span><p>2014 saw Iggy Azalea gain prominence with a hoard of rap hits. While not on the same commercial level as “Fancy,” “Black Widow” sent her and Rita Ora to the top spot. The catchy and dynamic collaboration blended pop and Hip Hop elements, catering to a wide audience. Correspondingly, it was one of the most popular rap hits of 2014 worldwide. “Black Widow” was the fifth single released from Azalea’s debut studio album, <a href=# rel>The New Classic</a>, and was a massive hit.

The song prominently samples Sir Mix-a-Lot’s iconic Hip Hop hit, “Baby Got Back,” which is known for its celebration of curvaceous women. “Anaconda” became one of the most popular rap hits of 2014, and arguably the most controversial. In spite of the backlash, however, the song’s popularity grew, and Minaj’s career only progressed further. “Anaconda” topped the Hot Rap Songs chart for six weeks, and is one of Minaj’s biggest tracks of all time.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Lil Wayne Talks “Kant Nobody” Collab, Says He Deserves No. 1 On “Top 50” List</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# class=text-word>Pitbull</a> - “Timber” Ft.
