His résumé is stacked with movies that have been blockbusters or gone on to win awards. There are too many to choose from when constructing a list of his best. However, we've managed to reel in nine standouts.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">9. The Great Debaters (2007)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some of Denzel Washington’s best work is when he depicts a real person.&nbsp;In The Great Debaters, he takes on the persona of debate coach Melvin B. Tolson of Wiley Coach.&nbsp;Not only does Washington star in it, but he also directed the 2007 film.&nbsp;This is one of his more important roles as the movie circulates around an all-Black college that defeats Harvard University in an academic debate.&nbsp;The plot is based on a true story, in which Denzel delivers a performance that shines a light on an essential fact in Black History and American History.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">8. Inside Man (2006)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some may want to see the bad guys get away, and some don’t.&nbsp;In Inside Man, Washington was up against a criminal mastermind he was no match for.&nbsp;It’s safe to say that Washington is comfortable portraying a police officer.&nbsp;However, this time, he isn’t dirty.&nbsp;Also, he once again works with director <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Spike Lee</a>.&nbsp;This is their fourth movie together as they have collaborated on Mo’ Better Blues, Malcolm X, and He Got Game.&nbsp;This might be their best one yet.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">7. Philadelphia (1993)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Denzel Washington<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> and Tom Hanks</a> joined forces early in their career. Long before they became the men they are today, the two starred in Philadelphia.&nbsp;Hanks plays a gay man suing his employer for firing him because he has AIDS.&nbsp;Washington portrays his lawyer, who was initially unwilling to take the case.&nbsp;This is one of the first big-screen Hollywood films to shed light on many certain shunned issues.&nbsp;Philadelphia touched on LGBTQ issues, HIV/AIDS epidemic, and discrimination.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">6. Training Day (2001)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Training Day might be Denzel’s most popular role.&nbsp;Everyone remembers Alonzo screaming, “King Kong ain’t got s*** on me!”&nbsp;Time and time again, Washington proves that there isn’t a role he can’t conquer.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Playing a dirty cop</a>, you hated him and were relieved when he was murdered. Washington made you feel a way with this role, as many people will always discuss Training Day when discussing the actor's career.&nbsp;The two main actors in the film, Washington and Ethan Hawke, won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">5. American Gangster (2007)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There is not a role that Denzel Washington can’t play.&nbsp;Whether he’s a fighter, pilot, coach, or cop, Washington makes it look effortless.&nbsp;He does it again in American Gangster as he plays notorious Harlem <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">crime boss Frank Lucas</a>.&nbsp;In another biopic for Washington, he embodies Lucas. It’s almost as if the characters and the setting aren't new to him.&nbsp;After all, he is from New York, so he may be familiar with tales of Lucas's street life moves.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">4. Glory (1989)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In 1989, Denzel received his first Oscar for his role in Glory. He won Best Supporting Actor for his role as Private Silas Trip.&nbsp;In Glory, the film focuses on Black men's contributions to the Civil War.&nbsp;It was one of the first big-screen Hollywood movies to shed light on Black soldiers then.&nbsp;This was just the beginning for Washington.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">3. Malcolm X (1992)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The way Denzel portrays real people is unmatched.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">In Malcolm X</a>, he acts and narrates the story of the late-great activist.&nbsp;From the slick back hair to the speech, Washington makes for the splitting image of Malcolm.&nbsp;With Denzel portraying one of the most influential figures in history, he may have had similar views to Malcolm.&nbsp;The film earned Washington an Oscar nomination.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">2. Fences (2016)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Decades later and he still knows how to give life to a character.&nbsp;In 2016, Denzel shone as Troy in Fences, with Viola Davis playing Rose, his wife.&nbsp;The film received several nominations and took home a few awards.&nbsp;In fact, Washington himself won a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Play.&nbsp; Fences was originally a play that first opened in 1985. It was revived in 2010 on Broadway.&nbsp;Washington and Davis starred in the play as well. Washington also won Outstanding Actor in a Leading Role in a Motion Picture for the film.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-1-remember-the-titans-2000>1. Remember the Titans (2000)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Denzel Washington simply excelled as Coach Herman Boone in Remember the Titans.&nbsp;Based on a true story, Washington embodies Coach Boone’s hard-nosed leadership attributes. It’s easy to get sucked into this film as you might even believe Washington really coaches high school football or has before.&nbsp;Remember the Titans is easily one of the best sports films ever.&nbsp; A movie about a team coming together during the time of segregation is powerful to see.&nbsp;Washington leads the way with an all-time performance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoVzhJJmm56mqpq5bsPArJ%2BippepvK95zKitop2j</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdenzel-washington-movies-his-best-roles-yet.html&text=Denzel%20Washington%20Movies%3a%20His%20Best%20Roles%20Yet&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdenzel-washington-movies-his-best-roles-yet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdenzel-washington-movies-his-best-roles-yet.html&title=Denzel%20Washington%20Movies%3a%20His%20Best%20Roles%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdenzel-washington-movies-his-best-roles-yet.html&title=Denzel%20Washington%20Movies%3a%20His%20Best%20Roles%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdenzel-washington-movies-his-best-roles-yet.html&title=Denzel%20Washington%20Movies%3a%20His%20Best%20Roles%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdenzel-washington-movies-his-best-roles-yet.html&description=Denzel%20Washington%20Movies%3a%20His%20Best%20Roles%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ed-razek-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ed Razek Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./breakdown-of-wwe-s-rise-and-aew-s-fall-in-television-viewership-for-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Breakdown of WWEs Rise and AEWs Fall in Television Viewership For 2023">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
